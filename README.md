 # Neuro-Steered Headphones for Auditory Attention Detection
 

 ## Overview
 

 This project explores the use of neuro-steered headphones to detect and respond to auditory attention. By monitoring brain activity, the headphones can identify when the user is focusing on a particular sound source and enhance that source while reducing background noise.
 

 ## Features
 

 *   **Real-time Auditory Attention Detection:** Utilizes EEG signals to identify the focus of auditory attention.
 *   **Adaptive Sound Enhancement:** Dynamically adjusts audio output to enhance the attended sound source.
 *   **Noise Reduction:** Filters out irrelevant background noise to improve clarity.
 *   **Customizable Profiles:** Allows users to create personalized profiles based on their listening preferences and cognitive patterns.
 *   **Integration with Existing Headphones:** Designed to be integrated with existing headphone models.
 

 ## Technologies Used
 

 *   **Electroencephalography (EEG):** Brain-computer interface for measuring brain activity.
 *   **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Algorithms for real-time audio processing and noise reduction.
 *   **Machine Learning:** Models trained to classify auditory attention based on EEG data.
 *   **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis, model training, and system control.
 *   **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
 

 ## Getting Started
 

 1.  **Prerequisites:**
  *   Install Python 3.x
  *   Install required Python packages: `pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn tensorflow`
 2.  **Clone the repository:**
  `git clone [repository URL]`
 3.  **Data Collection:**
  *   Use an EEG device to collect brainwave data while focusing on different sound sources.
 4.  **Model Training:**
  *   Run the training script to train the machine learning model: `python train_model.py`
 5.  **Integration:**
  *   Integrate the trained model with the headphone's audio processing unit.
