 # NeuroXones: Integrated EEG Brain-Computer Interface for AR/VR and Headphones

## Overview

NeuroXones is an advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) platform that integrates EEG technology with headphones and AR/VR headsets. By monitoring neural activity in real-time, the system maps brain responses to various auditory and visual stimuli, creating personalized models of cognitive function. These models enable adaptive audio experiences and enhanced AR/VR interactions based on the user's attention, emotional state, and cognitive load.

## Features

*   **Real-time Auditory Attention Detection:** Utilizes EEG signals to identify the focus of auditory attention.
*   **Adaptive Sound Enhancement:** Dynamically adjusts audio output to enhance the attended sound source.
*   **Noise Reduction:** Filters out irrelevant background noise to improve clarity.
*   **Neural Response Mapping:** Tracks and maps brain responses to different stimuli for training ML models.
*   **Cross-Platform Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with headphones and AR/VR headsets for comprehensive data collection.
*   **Immersive Training Environment:** Uses virtual environments to present controlled stimuli for precise brain mapping.
*   **Cognitive State Monitoring:** Detects and responds to changes in attention, cognitive load, and emotional states.
 
## Technologies Used

*   **Electroencephalography (EEG):** Brain-computer interface for measuring brain activity.
*   **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Algorithms for real-time audio processing and noise reduction.
*   **Machine Learning:** Neural networks trained to map and interpret brain activity patterns in response to various stimuli.
*   **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis, model training, and system control.
*   **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
*   **3D Visualization:** Three.js and WebGL for creating immersive environments for stimuli presentation.
*   **Web Technologies:** React.js for building the user interface and visualization components.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Stream processing frameworks for handling continuous EEG data flows.
 
## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
  *   Install Python 3.x
  *   Install required Python packages: `pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn tensorflow pandas mne pyvista`
  *   Install Node.js and npm for the web interface
2.  **Clone the repository:**
  `git clone [repository URL]`
3.  **Data Collection:**
  *   Connect an EEG device and calibrate the system using the setup wizard
  *   Use the immersive AR/VR environment to collect neural responses to controlled stimuli
4.  **Model Training:**
  *   Process collected EEG data: `python preprocess_data.py`
  *   Train personalized neural response models: `python train_model.py`
  *   Validate model performance: `python evaluate_model.py`
5.  **Integration:**
  *   Deploy trained models to connected devices: `python deploy_model.py --device=[headphones/ar/vr]`
  *   Start the real-time neural processing server: `python run_server.py`
  *   Launch the web interface: `npm start`

## Applications

*   **Research:** Enables detailed studies of neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli in controlled environments.
*   **Healthcare:** Assists in cognitive assessment and therapy through personalized stimulus response tracking.
*   **Entertainment:** Creates adaptive audio and AR/VR experiences that respond to the user's cognitive state.
*   **Productivity:** Enhances focus by dynamically adjusting the environment based on attention levels.
*   **Accessibility:** Provides alternative control mechanisms for individuals with motor impairments.
